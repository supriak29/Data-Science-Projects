1. Most sold products all together (Pie chart)
2. Highest sales in which month (Bar chart) / In which city most of the orders take place

-------------

1. Feather data - stores data in binary format

2. Pandas 
		-> Data Manipulation

3. numpy 
		-> to perform any numerical computations over numerical data

4. visualization 
		-> matplotlib
		-> Seaborn - beautiful looking plot very quickly
		-> Plotly - Dynamic plot

I. Understanding Use case

II. Data Preprocessing: ETL pipeline

	1. Extract Data:
		- import data - feather file
		- raw data
	
	2. Transform data into acceptable format
		- duplicate rows?
		- irrelevant rows?
		- is there any error?
		- missing value?
		- data types?

III. EDA 

	1.which is the best month for sale? 
		- best = maximum sale (any month having max sale is considered best month for sale)
				- sales = qty*price
				- month - extract using funct.
		- sum the sales for each month
				- group by: Month
				- sum: sales for each month
		- plot graph
	
	2. which city has maximum order?
		- fetch the city 
		- keep its count(freq. table): pd.value_counts(all_data['city'])
	
	3. What product sold the most & Why?
	
		i. WHY?
			- good user rating
			- low price
			- 
		ii. Table:
			- product --- group by 
			- qty ordered ~ (total qty for each product) --- sum()
			- price each ~ (avg. price for that product) --- mean()
		
		iii. Axis for graph
			- x:  product
			- y1: order_count --- bar graph
			- y2: avg price of the product --- line graph
	
	4. Understanding Trend of the most sold product ?
	
		- most sold product: most purchased products by the user
		- pivot table
		
	5. What products are most often sold together ?
	
		- keep duplicated order id
		- group that order id
		- list all products for that order id in new column
		- use join() and ',' separator ---- with the help of lambda
		
		Order_id	Product		', '.join(x)
